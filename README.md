# JavaScript.tmLanguage
Better JavaScript language definition for TextMate and SublimeText. This builds on the language files commonly used and adds more fine grained matching and also includes new features from ECMAScript 6 like modules, succinct methods, arrow functions, classes, generators, and accessors (ES5).

This is a fork of [JavaScriptNext.tmLanguage](https://github.com/Benvie/JavaScriptNext.tmLanguage) with colors that resemble those used in the [Monokai-Phoenix](https://github.com/s10wen/Monokai-Phoenix) Theme.
